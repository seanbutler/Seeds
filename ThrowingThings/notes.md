Perlin noise (& other similar value noises)  is commonly used as a source of information to form the basis of landscape algorithms.

A very common application of Perlin Noise is of course to make landscapes, particularly oceanic landscapes.

Another way to consider it is as a manipulation of one kind of noise from a random source into another kind of noise with a bit more structure. This translation happens by seeding the combination of multiple waveforms together into a single artefact with significantly different scales. In particular it translates the (white?, gaussian?) input noise into a soft of repeatable waveform.
